# Example App for `@capgo/capacitor-shake`

This Vite project links directly to the local plugin source so you can exercise the native APIs while developing.

## Actions in this playground

- **Start shake listener** – Registers a shake listener and logs events below.
- **Stop shake listener** – Removes the active shake listener.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Add native shells with `npx cap add ios` or `npx cap add android` from this folder to try behaviour on device or simulator.
